# Intrusion-Detection-using-Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Models

Intrusion detection is a process of identifying unauthorized access or malicious activity in a computer system. It is an important aspect of network security and helps to prevent malicious attacks and unauthorized access.

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Extra Trees Classifier, and XGBoost are three machine learning algorithms that can be used for intrusion detection.

KNN is a simple and effective algorithm that classifies data based on its similarity to other data points in the training set. In the case of intrusion detection, KNN can be used to classify network traffic as either normal or malicious based on the similarity of the traffic to other known network traffic patterns. The algorithm assigns the majority class of the K nearest neighbors to a new sample, which is used for classification.

Extra Trees Classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy of the predictions. It creates a number of decision trees and combines their predictions to form a final prediction. In the case of intrusion detection, Extra Trees Classifier can be used to classify network traffic as normal or malicious based on the features of the network traffic.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a gradient boosting algorithm that has been designed for fast and efficient training of large datasets. It uses decision trees as the base model and trains multiple decision trees in a sequential manner. In the case of intrusion detection, XGBoost can be used to classify network traffic as normal or malicious based on the features of the network traffic.

In conclusion, KNN, Extra Trees Classifier, and XGBoost are machine learning algorithms that can be used for intrusion detection by classifying network traffic as either normal or malicious based on the similarity of the traffic to other known network traffic patterns in the case of KNN, and based on the features of the network traffic in the case of Extra Trees Classifier and XGBoost.
